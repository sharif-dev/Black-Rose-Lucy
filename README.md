Mobile Midterm Paper

When you hear "organized crime" you probably think of underground drug dealer companies or thief networks which work together to achieve an illegal goal. In the darknet, however, crime has a different shape. There has been a hot topic in darknet named MaaS or Malware-as-a-service developed by some underground hacker groups and sold to individuals by different prices. A person can use MaaS to infect some victims without much computer knowledge. It is easier and cheaper than finding a group of experienced hackers and asking them to develop your malware from scratch. In this paper, we are taking a closer look at one of these MaaS providers called "Lucy Gang" a Russian group that first seen in 2018 when checkpoint researchers wrote an article about them. Then we will take a closer look at their new software in 2020 and find out about the way it works and its interesting self-protection mechanisms. Finally, we are going to point out some ways to stay safe from these malware programs.
